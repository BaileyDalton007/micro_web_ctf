# Milk Clicker

Here, we are given a simple clicker game. It seems as though our score needs to reach 8 billion to get our flag.

We *really* should not click the milk 8 billion times, even with an auto clicker that would take forever.

The page refreshes whenever we click the milk (seen by the circle spinning on the tab); however, our score is tracked.

This means the score is being stored somewhere. Cookies!

Opening the developer tools (Ctrl+Shift+I on Chrome) and navigating to the Application tab, we can view the cookies for this webpage.

Here, we see a score cookie that matches up with the displayed score on the webpage. Let's try modifying it and refreshing the page (or clicking the milk).

Setting our score to over 8 billion and refreshing gives us the flag!
