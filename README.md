# Micro Web CTF

## Overview
Here is a collection of small, fairly simple, capture the flag challenges.
This serves as the [Bailey Dalton's](https://github.com/BaileyDalton007) final project for CSDS285: Linux Tools and Scripting, so there is a particular emphasis on challenges involving scripts such as bash, php, javascript or awk.
If you enjoy this, consider joining [CyberCWRU](https://github.com/CyberCWRU) for more.
All flags will be of the format: CYCWRU{...}
Good Luck!
